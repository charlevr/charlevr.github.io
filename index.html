      <p>
        Hello! My name is Charles and I am currently a 4th year computer science student
        at University of California, Irvine. In terms on coding, I am interested in backend
        or front end development as well machine learning. My goal is to go into software
        engineering and eventually get a Masters or PhD studying applications of machine learning.
        That being said, here are the languages I can code in:
        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>C and C++</li>
          <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript (Yes, HTML and CSS are not languages though.)</li>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>Julia</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For my personal projects and school projects I also use a variety of technologies.
        Here are the technologies that I use often and am comfortable with:
        <ul>
          <li>MySQL/SQL</li>
          <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
          <li>Docker</li>
          <li>Ubuntu and Windows</li>
          <li>Git</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally, since I am interested in machine learning, naturally I use a variety
        of python libraries to aid in building models and analyzing data. There are a lot of 
        natural language processing libraries I am familiar with since that is the main focus
        of my undergraduate research. Here they are:
        <ul>
          <li>ntlk (tokenization)</li>
          <li>pandas (data cleaning and manipulation)</li>
          <li>numpy/scipy (vector manipulation and general math functions)</li>
          <li>scikit-learn (non-deep learning models)</li>
          <li>spaCy and fasttext (sentential embeddings and NLP pipelines</li>
          <li>PyTorch (deep learning models such as LSTM and RNN)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I get frustrated with coding, I like to play and watch basketball, watch 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/TheMuffinMang123">anime</a>, playing video games like Super Smash Bros and League of Legends,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1217905829?si=TROR0WKVRz6RaokrZ9pVWA">listening to *any* music</a>, 
        and drink water. Feel free to poke around
        the website and check out the projects that I have done!
